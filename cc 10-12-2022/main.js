// Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

// If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

// In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

// More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

// Example: (input --> output)

// "ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
// "GTAT" --> "CATA"

//P: The function will take in a string 
//R: The function will return a string 
//E: "ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
//P: input will be a string if a certain letter function will return another

function DNAStrand(dna){
    console.log(dna.split('')
    

    )
  }

  let dna = "ATTGC"
  DNAStrand(dna)
